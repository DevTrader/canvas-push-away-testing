# canvas-push-away-testing
testing natural algorithm to create a "prey vs predator" effect, still needs to invert acceleration without retrigger

## To do:
-Switch acceleration of particles once they reach the area of the mouse
-Make them ignore the area of the mouse for a short duration after they have switched acceleration 
-Make them go to random position (with random "swervy" path maybe?), to look like they dash away at first.
